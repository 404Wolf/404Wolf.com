    "description":"Bitwarden, a popular open source and free password manager, does a great job of securely storing passwords and other personal data in their cloud, well-encrypted and accessible. However, their option to export your vault (to maintain a local/physical backup) is to export it as a .json file, leaving data in a very human-unfriendly format. So, I made a program that converts the json to a more human readable html file, which one can print onto physical paper. In addition, I've integrated automatic favicon/icon fetching, QR code generation, databreach checks and more."
