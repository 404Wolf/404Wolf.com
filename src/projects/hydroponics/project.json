    "description":"Gardening is slow. One must input lots of effort to achieve only a meager harvest. For a typical house plant, one only gets a few peppers, or maybe 3-4 tomatoes, if any. I've decided to grow basil, a naturally fast-growing plant, hydroponically, with powerful grow lights, in my closet, to achieve as much pesto as possible within as short a time period as possible. Rather than a few leaves every other week, within the space of a small closet I have been able to produce multiple cups of pesto weekly."
