                    I've always been an impulsive tinkerer. An eager explorer and fervent maker. So, naturally, I'm a highly project based personâ€”from my 3D printed avocado journey to a massive hydroponic basic farm embarkment to a Minecraft username autoclaiming business. While I was originally interested in art, and loved dumping ideas into the endless canvas of graphic design, 3D modeling, and crafty projects, code's been my true, inevitable passion.

                    Being able to apply my ingenuity, creativity, and curiosity into a virtually limitless realm has been endlessly enticing. With code, there's really no end to discovery, and there never will be. So while one day I may be scouring the intricacies of QT, another I may be self-teaching React to build a portfolio website. But, while code's provided countless enticing chances for complex problem-solving and conscientious strategizing, it's the truly infinite opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and meaningful exploration that excite me most.
