    "description": "My closet's taken many forms. First, it was LARP equipment (foam sword-fighting), followed by a Kombucha brewing apparatus, and intermediately a quilt-sowing setup and 3d-printing haven. However, most recently it's taken the form of a hydroponic farm. This post documents my journey from the very beginning, starting off with my soil based auto-watering strawberry endeavor, spanning to the present, with my current hydroponic Shishito Pepper growing setup. I discuss the inspiration, process, pitfalls, and ultimate success of my hydroponic journey."
