# The roots
## Starting off
It was 2019, the summer before high school. Many projects were coming to a close, and I was still unburdened by schoolwork. My vinyl wall Office-Quote sticker endeavor had completed; my 3d-printed avocado production had died down. My interest in tech was beginning, and I wanted to learn Arduino in a practical and applied way before high school. My closet had just freed up from my Kombucha brewing apparatus, and was ripe for project-iation. I wasn't ready to let it sit dormant, so I decided to transform the closet into an automated garden.

## Setup
The first phase of the closet garden was, in fact, not actually hydroponics. My research began by looking for fast growing, easily maintainable plants, and I settled on strawberries. I bought some seeds on ebay, and decided on a grow tower to maximize the area of my closet. If successful, there'd be room for many more towers, but I'd start with one. Meanwhile, I set up an Arduino system to automatically disperse water from a large bucket when the soil dried up, using a soil moisture sensor, and I covered the walls in mylar sheeting to maximize the light hitting the plants. I purchased relays, and cut an extension cord, putting the positive wire across the relay, so I could control the lights with my Arduino too. As time progressed, the Arduino didn't water often enough, or, when reconfigured, over-watered, leaking water, so I pivoted to timer-based-watering. For lighting, I settled on a sketchy, cheap Amazon grow light, which melted itself and set off my GFCI outlet. The replacement one I got was better, but still wasn't bright enough, and then the third choice worked well, though it heated up my closet to an ambient 85.  

## Success

Within a few weeks, most of the strawberries germinated, and the plants began thriving. They began branching out, and runners (baby plants attached to the mother plant) started shooting out. Within weeks, flowers appeared, and then the first few fruits. They were juicy, bright red, and perfectâ€”until the mold started. I tried adding a dehumidifier, and bought Neem oil as a natural fungicide to protect the edibility of the fruit, but it was futile. After caving to synthetic fungicide, I rid the plants of fungus, and effectively made the plant ornamental for months to come. In the meantime, I began planning for the next season.

## Assembled Grow Tower

For my first attempt, I decided to go with an Amazon [basil grow rack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0787F9LG7/), since it claimed to provide an all-in-one system that only required simple assembly. A bit weary of leakage, I carefully put it together, and put my basil into the included grow pods. For the first few weeks, while figuring out ideal nutrient ratios and water acidity, the basil began growing. However, I quickly ran into a roadblock: the small tubes were being jammed by the ever-growing basil plants' roots. The larger the plants got, the more unwieldy the system became, and the less water the plants received as a result of the jamming. Moreover, cleaning the system was virtually impossible without removing all the plants and disassembling the tubes. Unfortunately, I needed to change gears, but, on the brighter side, I did establish hydroponic basil as a plant with potential.
