Hi! My name is Wolf Mermelstein, and I'm a Case Western student intending to major in CS. I recently graduated from [Bard HS Early College](https://bhsec.bard.edu/queens/), and just finished a [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) programming retreat. This website was created initially as an excuse to teach myself fullstack, but has morphed into a space for me to dump useful information about techy encounters, projects, and myself. Hopefully this page gives you more insight into my interests, skills, personality, and abilities.

To put things briefly, I've always been interested in problem solving and figuring things out. I enjoy learning through doing and tinkering, and it has led me to undertake multifarious personal projects. I've always like hands-on things like crafts, and used to be interested in acrylic painting and sowing. For a while I undertook various experimental pursuits like yogurt culturing, or bulk kombucha brewing. And, for a while I was very interested in design: I went through a phase of 3D modeling, Adobe Illustrator, and cinematography with Premiere. Through various different art-sy design projects, I grew to learn that though I did enjoy design, it was the design software that interested me most. I loved learning about advanced program features, and messing with configurations. Throughout my earlier, exploratory stages of life, however, one interest has always persisted: tech. Whether it be messing with my dad's antiquated iMac, toying around with 3D printers, or making robots at a local robotics camp, it was always an area of interest. But interacting with interfaces wasn't enough; I'd always wanted to learn more about the actually underpinnings of apps. Since I didn't have any proper coding classes in elementary school or middle school, I decided early on in high school that, like for various other interests, I'd just have to take it on myself. And, as usual, I began the journey with small-scale eclectic projects.

While I started off with Python-learner projects like a Pig-Latin translator or terminal-based tic-tac-toe game, I quickly grew bored of copying project ideas from other people, and decided to adventure off into more advanced endeavors further beyond the scopes of my knowledge (at the time). One of first personal coding projects was a D&D character sheet viewing tool. I also designed some simple scripts to move around and organize my computer's windows, and contrived various other automation tools. But it was over 10th grade summer where I began my first larger-scale personal project: Minecraft username sniping. It was a very simple concept that was, in practice, extremely complicated and fun to implement. I coded systems to automatically attempt to grab desirable usernames (like real-world usernames) at the exact millisecond they were to free up (after users changed their username), and then held auctions to resell the accounts with the valuable names that my bots automatically claimed. I learned how to automate server deployment, a bit about SFTP, integrating with APIs, how to write async Python to implement concurrent requests, various advanced features of Python and OOP, and more. By the end of that summer Mojang ended up making many breaking changes to their API and I sold the project, but it was then clearer than ever that software was my ultimate passion, and one that I'd need to further explore.

In 12th grade I first began formally advancing my passion, but still in a very self-led way. In senior year I set up a custom data-structures tutorial-course with another student and our CS professor, where I got to learn the basics of some CS concepts that I missed during my more informal project-based experiences. In the 'course,' since I and a peer were the first first to undergo it, we worked to design a curriculum for us, but also for future students, since the plan is to eventually make it a regular class at the school. Around the same time, began working on a DNA-Nanotech design tool, which took the form of a research project with my physics professor. It let me more meaningfully apply the skills I picked up informally, and was a great opportunity to learn more about the issues accompanying UI/UX design and maintainability. Integrating CS into a completely unfamiliar field was really fun. Via the project I was able to create a design tool of my own, which was something I'd always wanted to do, and towards the end of the year I had a great experience attending the Nadrian Seeman memorial at NYU, learning more about the field and its frontiers. At the time, most of my experience had been in Python, not just because of my love for the crisp syntax, also because of its multitudinous libraries. It was inspiring to see how this paradigm of extend-ability is one which was not unique to just CS.

Since graduating high school, I've shifted to explore additional new CS areas. To start, I decided to self-teach the fundamentals of HTML/CSS, since I'm very interested in working on more visual and accessible projects. Archeteching APIs is definitely something I like doing, but I also find it super satisfying to design and slot the logic into a UI for end users. At around the same time, I decided that it'd be best to put the knowledge to use building a personal website, since I've found that my favorite way to learn is through implementing into projects with actual utility, and it was through this initial dive into front-end where I quickly (perhaps as usual) spiraled into a chain of rabbit-holes that led me to spend significant time learning javascript/typescript, react and nextjs, along with various other fullstack tools like postgress and S3. Again, I've come to love the tooling of the realm, just like how I enjoy tinkering with design software when I was younger. Often the process of getting things to work as intended is one consistent of many headaches and grueling hours, but the payoff is immesurable. And while I do like digging into figuring out how frameworks work, I find there to be a beauty to abstractions, and especially love creating my own. Based off all my prior experience with CS, though I'm still exploring various areas of CS, and am not fully certain which tech area most interests me, I've come to find that this novel realm of fullstack has been most enticing to me. It's a infinite array of tools to explore, and an enticing mechanism to rapidly reify my ideas.

# Skills

#### Fast Typist
I'm able to type 90-100+WPM. This is something I've been working on consistently since middle school, and I do believe is a vital skill. I'm still improving!

#### Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator
I first began working with Illustrator all the way back in elementary school, when I played a major part in my year's yearbook design. Since then, I've used it to design marketing graphics at one of my jobs, and have tinkered with it to contrive art, create posters, and more for personal projects.

#### Python 3
Since 9th grade I've been self-teaching Python through countless projects, articles, videos, and experiments. At this point, I'm quite adept in the language, and have some experience with UI design with PyQt6. I've also worked with asyncio/aiohttp/flask in the past for backend api development. I feel I have a pretty good grasp of the OOP concepts and more advanced features surrounding the language.

#### Fullstack Stuff
Over the past few months, as part of building out this persona website I've been self teaching `typescript` and `react`. Since, as usual, I've gone very far over-engineering my website, I've learned `next.js`, `prisma`, and a bit about `s3` too as I've built out a backend and integrated a database to allow for a WYSIWYG automated post editor.

#### English & Latin Language
I'm a fluent English speaker, and believe that I have a very good grasp on the language. I've also just completed four years of Latin, which I've loved specifically because of how it's let me strengthen my grasp of English grammar and come to better understand how various words have come to be. Lingua Latina optima lingua est!

#### Math to Calculus (2)
At this point I've taken math courses up to Calculus 2. We didn't make it past geometric series unfortunately, but I'm planning on self teaching them this summer. I love how calculus compiles and applies all prior math knowledge, and also enjoy the discreet/explicit nature of it. In addition to calc, I have a firm grasp on Algebra and Trigonometry, along with some Geometry experience.

# Qualities

* I love problem-solving, and do think I'm good at deriving creative solutions to complex problems, but believe that my real uniqueness stems from my desire to fully comprehend solutions, and my ability to learn from past problems.

* When it comes to code, I care as much about form as I do function. So while yes, this does sometimes lead to long deliberations over variable naming, it also fosters clarity and comprehensively, and not just blind conformity to style guides.

* I am very detail-oriented. Though I wouldn't call myself a perfectionist, but, when I have the time and opportunity, I'll go out of my way to spend time figuring out how to do things the right way, even if it's convoluted and tedious. 

* Through Ancient Latin experience, along with my eclectic english vocab flashcard deck project and a public speaking course in high school, I've come to be quite good at conveying ideas and information.

* I'm very computer-literate, and am able to intuit software very readily. I've been tinkering with computers since I was little and am good at learning from documentation and experimentation.

* I am good at managing time, though I prefer working on one thing at a time rather than trying to spread myself too thin multitasking. I'm also quite organized, when it comes to life, but also code and projects digitally.

* I'm generally a very curious person who likes tackling things that interest me without external influence. Chasing down interests has been something I've always been inclined to do, and is an important quality.
