![Profile image of me](profileMe|width=45|float=right)

Hi! My name is Wolf Mermelstein, and I'm a Case Western student intending to major in CS. I recently graduated from [Bard HS Early College](https://bhsec.bard.edu/queens/), and currently I'm spending the summer at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-driven programming retreat. This website was created initially as an excuse to teach myself fullstack, but has morphed into a space for me to dump useful information about myself and my projects. Hopefully this page gives you more insight into my interests, skills, personality, and abilities.

In general, I'd consider myself to be very self-driven. I enjoy learning through doing, and it has led me to undertake multifarious personal projects, ranging from closet hydroponics, to sowing LARP equipment, to yogurt culturing, to numerous coding endeavors. Via a data-structures course I set up at my school, I've been able to expand my computational-thinking abilities, and through a DNA-Nanotech research project I've got to apply much of what I've learned. I'm still exploring, and am not fully certain which tech area most interests me, but at the moment I'm focused on fullstack.

While over the past years I've undertaken smaller projects, I've moved on in recent years to focus more on larger projects. I find it more rewarding to work towards an elusive end goal and fall down infinite rabbit holes than to explore concepts and frameworks in isolation. I've found that my larger projects, such as NATuG, a nucleic acid nanotube design aid that I've been developing, or my website, which you're accessing right now, serve purposes greater than that of education, which makes the learning experience itself extremely fun and enticing.

Beyond tech, I, of course, have other interests too. Since I was little I've loved D&D, though I haven't played too much in recent years. I also really like strategy board games, which I've been collecting the past decade, with my favorites being larger scale social deduction games like `Dead of Winter`. Additionally, I tend to spend some of my free time when not coding studying spaced repetition Latin and English vocab flashcards, running, overthinking solutions to subjective problems, re-watching Shark Tank and The Office, and maintaining my hydroponic closet garden.

# Skills

#### Fast Typist
I'm able to type 90-100+WPM. This is something I've been working on consistently since middle school, and I do believe is a vital skill. I'm still improving!

#### Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator
I first began working with Illustrator all the way back in elementary school, when I played a major part in my year's yearbook design. Since then, I've used it to design marketing graphics at one of my jobs, and have tinkered with it to contrive art, create posters, and more for personal projects.

#### Python 3
Since 9th grade I've been self-teaching Python through countless projects, articles, videos, and experiments. At this point, I'm quite adept in the language, and have some experience with UI design with PyQt6. I've also worked with asyncio/aiohttp/flask in the past for backend api development. I feel I have a pretty good grasp of the OOP concepts and more advanced features surrounding the language.

#### JS/TS, HTML/CSS, React
Over the past few months, as part of building out this persona website I've been self teaching `typescript` and `react`. Since, as usual, I've gone very far over-engineering my website, I've learned `next.js`, `prisma`, and a bit about `s3` too as I've built out a backend and integrated a database to allow for a WYSIWYG automated post editor.

#### English & Latin Language
I'm a fluent English speaker, and believe that I have a very good grasp on the language. I've also just completed four years of Latin, which I've loved specifically because of how it's let me strengthen my grasp of English grammar and come to better understand how various words have come to be. Lingua Latina optima lingua est!

#### Math to Calculus (2)
At this point I've taken math courses up to Calculus 2. We didn't make it past geometric series unfortunately, but I'm planning on self teaching them this summer. I love how calculus compiles and applies all prior math knowledge, and also enjoy the discreet/explicit nature of it. In addition to calc, I have a firm grasp on Algebra and Trigonometry, along with some Geometry experience.

# Qualities

* I love problem-solving, and do think I'm good at deriving creative solutions to complex problems, but believe that my real uniqueness stems from my desire to fully comprehend solutions, and my ability to learn from past problems.

* When it comes to code, I care as much about form as I do function. So while yes, this does sometimes lead to long deliberations over variable naming, it also fosters clarity and comprehensively, and not just blind conformity to style guides.

* I am very detail-oriented. Though I wouldn't call myself a perfectionist, but, when I have the time and opportunity, I'll go out of my way to spend time figuring out how to do things the right way, even if it's convoluted and tedious. 

* Through Ancient Latin experience, along with my eclectic english vocab flashcard deck project and a public speaking course in high school, I've come to be quite good at conveying ideas and information.

* I'm very computer-literate, and am able to intuit software very readily. I've been tinkering with computers since I was little and am good at learning from documentation and experimentation.

* I am good at managing time, though I prefer working on one thing at a time rather than trying to spread myself too thin multitasking. I'm also quite organized, when it comes to life, but also code and projects digitally.
