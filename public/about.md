Hi! My name is Wolf Mermelstein, and I'm a student who'll begin attending Case Western university with a major in Computer Science next fall, and previously I previously attended Bard High School Early college. I'm from Brooklyn, NY, and am a geeky, curious, creative, tech-loving humanoid with a passion for problem-solving, making, and exploring. This website is bifold: an excuse to teach myself fullstack, and a place to dump useful information about myself. Hopefully this page gives you more insight into my interests, skills, and personality, and abilities.

If I had to put it simply, I'm a very self-driven person. Most of my interests arise from my own exploration and experimentation. Through personal pursuits ranging all the way from closet Basil hydroponics to sowing intricate equipment for foam-swordfighting in NYC, to brewing kombucha, to coding a complex Minecraft minigame, and more, I've nurtured the curiosity that's led me to love coding. I love CS because of how vast the field is, but also because of how much limitless turf there is for tinkering and figuring things out.

At the moment, I'm still not certain which specific tech area interests me most, however. Through my eclectic projects I've taught myself the intricacies of Python, and have recently been exploring `typescript`, `React`, and `Next.js`. Via a data-structures course I set up at my school, I've been able to expand my computational-thinking abilities, and through a DNA-Nanotech research project I've got to apply much of what I've learned. I'm still exploring, but at the moment I'm most interested in fullstack development, simply because it's a skill-set that seems most conducive to transforming ideas to realities.

While over the past few years I've applied my coding abilities (and coasted on on-the-go self-teaching) for smaller projects like a Google Photos backup tool, and larger ones like my prior Minecraft username sniping business, I've moved on in recent years to focus more on larger projects. I find it more rewarding to work towards an elusive end goal and fall down infinite rabbit holes, than to explore concepts and frameworks in isolation. I've found that my larger projects, such as NATuG, a nucleic acid nanotube design aid that I've been developing, or my website, which you're accessing right now, serve purposes greater than that of education, which makes the learning experience itself extremely fun and enticing.

Of course, I have other interests too! Since I was little I've loved dungeons and dragons, though I haven't played a lot of it in recent years. I also really like strategy board games, which I've collected over the past decade. My favorites are larger scale social deduction games, like `Dead of Winter` or `Avalon`. In addition, I tend to spend some of my free time when not coding studying spaced repetition Latin and English vocab flashcards, running, overthinking solutions to subjective problems, re-watching Shark Tank and The Office, and maintaining my hydroponic closet garden.

# Qualities

I hope that the bio above provided a good sense of who I am as a person, but I'd also like to formally highlight some more tangible, specific qualities.

* I love problem-solving, and do think I'm good at deriving creative solutions to complex problems, but believe that my real uniqueness stems from my impulsive and insatiable need to fully comprehend solutions, and my ability to learn from past problems.

* When it comes to code, I care as much about form as I do function. So while yes, this does sometimes lead to long deliberations over variable name is most intuitive and clear, it also fosters clarity and comprehensively, and not just blind conformity to style guides.

* I am very detail-oriented. I wouldn't say I'm a perfectionist, but, when I have the time and opportunity, I'll go out of my way to spend time figuring out trivial things in interesting ways. For instance, I spent two days recently learning how to customize markdown-ASTs so I could get them to render in a very specific, custom way. 

* I'm very articulate, and feel I am able to convey my thinking with a sufficient degree of clarity. I've nurtured this quality through my interest in Ancient Latin, my eclectic english vocab flashcard deck, and a public speaking course in high school. I enjoy sharing my thoughts, but also like learning about alternative methods to tackle problems, which is yet another reason why I love CS.

* This may go without saying, but I'm very computer-literate, and am able to intuit software very readily. I've been tinkering with computers ever since I was extremely little, and love exploring software. I'm good at learning from documentation and experimentation, and enjoy learning how to operate complex and seemingly overwhelming tools. It's a hurtle at first, but very rewarding when things click.

* As aforementioned, I'm very self-driven, and am able to work independently efficiently. I'm also fairly good at managing time, although it is worth noting that I prefer working on one thing at a time rather than trying to spread myself too thin multitasking. Moreover, I'm also quite organized, when it comes to life, but also code and projects. I obsess over digital organization, which, in my opinion, is a positive trait that generally pays off down the line.

# Skills

#### Quick & Eager Learner
Through coding, Latin, and projects, I've grown very good at picking up on content quickly, comprehending problems, and contriving solutions.

#### Fast Typist
I'm able to type 90-100+WPM. This is something I've been working on consistently since middle school, and I do believe is a vital skill. I'm still improving!

#### Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator
I first picked up on Illustrator all the way back in elementary school, when I was most interested in art. I played a major part in my year's yearbook design that year, and have since used Photoshop/Illustrator to contrive art, create posters, and more.

#### Python 3
Since 9th grade I've been self-teaching Python through countless projects, articles, videos, and experiments. At this point, I'm quite adept in the language, and have some experience with UI design with PyQt6. I've also worked with asyncio/aiohttp/flask in the past for backend api development.

#### JS/TS, HTML/CSS, React
Over the past few months, as part of building out this persona website I've been self teaching `typescript` and `react`. Since, as usual, I've gone very far over-engineering my website, I've learned `next.js`, `prisma`, and a bit about `s3` too as I've built out a backend and integrated a database into this website.

#### English & Latin Language
I'm a fluent English speaker, and believe that I have a very good grasp on the language. I've also just completed four years of Latin, which I've loved specifically because of how it's let me strengthen my grasp of English grammar and gain understanding of how various words have come to be. Lingua Latina optima lingua est!

#### Math to Calculus (2)
At this point I've taken math courses up to Calculus 2. We didn't make it past geometric series unfortunately, but I'm planning on self teaching them this summer. I love how calculus compiles and applies all prior math knowledge, and also enjoy the discreet/explicit nature of it. I also have a firm grasp on Algebra and Trigonometry, and some experience with Geometry.
