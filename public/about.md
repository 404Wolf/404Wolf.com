Hi! My name is Wolf Mermelstein, and I'm a student currently attending Bard High School Early College Queens intending to major in Computer Science next year. I'm from Brooklyn, NY, and am a geeky, curious, creative, tech-loving humanoid with a passion for problem-solving, making, and exploring. Hopefully this page gives you more insight into my interests, skills, and personality, and abilities.

I'm very self-driven, so most of my interests arise from my own exploration and experimentation. I've always loved tinkering and experimentation. Through personal pursuits ranging all the way from closet Basil hydroponics to sowing intricate equipment for foam-swordfighting in NYC, to brewing kombucha, to coding a complex Minecraft minigame, and more, I've nurtured a curiosity that's led me to my ultimate vocation. After numerous eclectic coding projects, fervent internet scouring, RealPython and Stackoverflow journeys, and eager Youtube excursions I've come to find that it's Computer Science interests me most. It's provided an endless means of delectable problem-solving, and the intrinsic interdisciplinarity that I crave.

Though I've honed in on CS, I'm still not certain whcih area interests me most. Through project-iation, I've taught myself the intricacies of Python, and am currently exploring JS and React. Via a custom data-structures course that I helped set up at my school, I've been able to expand my computational-thinking abilities, and through my DNA-Nanotech project I've learned the importance of keeping end users in mind. The ability to contrive complex, repeatable, explicit instructions to problems, with tradeoffs in mind greatly allures me, in part because of the strategic nature of it. With CS, there's always a seemingly infinite number of possible ways to solve problems, and always the possibility for improvement.

While over the past few years I've applied my coding abilities (and coasted on on-the-go self-teaching) for smaller projects like a Google Photos backup tool, and larger ones like my prior Minecraft username sniping business, my most recent endeavor has completely altered my perspective. The ability to contribute to a completely unrelated field has been magical because of how requisite it was for the task. I firmly believe that the future of science itself is code, and can't wait to explore additional applications for CS in the future.

# Qualities

Though my bio should give a good sense of who I am as a person, I'd like to highlight some specific qualities that I believe set me apart.

* I love problem-solving, and do think I'm good at deriving creative solutions to complex problems, but believe that my real uniqueness stems from my impulsive and insatiable need to fully comprehend solutions, and my ability to learn from past problems.

* When it comes to code, I care as much about form as I do function. So while yes, this does sometimes lead to long deliberations over variable name is most intuitive and clear, it also fosters clarity and comprehensively, and not just blind conformity to style guides.

* This may go without saying, but I'm very computer-literate, and am able to intuit software very readily. I'm also good at learning from documentation and experimentation, which to a large extent is what got me to where I am today.

# Skills

* Quick & Eager Learner
Through coding, Latin, and projects, I've grown very good at picking up on content quickly, comprehending problems, and contriving solutions.

* Fast Typist
I'm able to type 90-100+WPM. This is something I've been working on consistently since middle school, and I do believe is a vital skill. I'm still improving!

* Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator
I first picked up on Illustrator all the way back in elementary school, when I was most interested in art. I played a major part in my year's yearbook design that year, and have since used Photoshop/Illustrator to contrive art, create posters, and more.

* Python 3
Since 9th grade I've been self-teaching Python through countless projects, articles, videos, and experiments. At this point, I'm quite adept in the language, and have some experience with UI design with PyQt6. I've also worked with asyncio/aiohttp/flask in the past for backend api development.

* JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React
I've been learning JS/React over the past few months to develop this website, and at this point have a fairly good grasp on the basics. I also have experience with Next.js, html, css, and tailwind css.

* English & Latin Language
I'm a fluent English speaker, and believe that I have a very good grasp on the language. I've also been studying Latin for 4 years, and am currently taking advanced Latin at my school. Lingua Latina optima lingua est!
