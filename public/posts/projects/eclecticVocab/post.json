    "description": "My eclectic, carefully curated deck of English vocab words that are both useful and mostly advanced/not very common. Many words are taken from Webster's words of the Day page, but lots are also from my readings/experiences too. All words are words that I did not originally know and that I believe are genuinely useful. I've made a custom, styled template for the deck, and have put together images and audio for each card!"
