    "description": "Conglomeration, obstreperous, mercurial, preantepenultimate, rapacious, verisimilitude. For some, it's coinsâ€”for me, words. Over the past year, I've fastidiously curated those with intriguing meanings, idyllic spellings, eccentric pronunciations, and compelling origins. Bolstering my lexicon and piquing my logophilia. An engrossing use of free-time tranches. A process as delightful as the product."
