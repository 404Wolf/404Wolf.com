# TLDR

My eclectic, carefully curated deck of English vocab words that are both useful and mostly advanced/not very common. Many words are taken from Webster's words of the Day page, but lots are also from my readings/experiences too. All words are words that I did not originally know and that I believe are genuinely useful. I've made a custom, styled template for the deck, and have put together images and audio for each card!

# The deck

As I encounter new, unknown words, I've stored them away in a [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) backlog. I've gotten into the habit of allocating a corner of my loose leaf that I use for notes for vocab words that I don't yet know, and stay up to date with the [Merriam-Webster word of the day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day). Since I don't want to commit completely useless words into my lexicon for no reason, I do some vetting, checking their usage over time, recent usage, and the applicability of the word, before batch adding words to my [spaced-repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) flashcard deck. 

## Spaced repetition

Spaced repetition is a special evidence-based flashcard studying method wherein cards are automatically shown to you at specific intervals based on your response to remembering the card, as to show you the card at the moment before you are predicted to forget it. That is, the more you forget a card, the more often you will encounter the card, and the better you get at remembering it, the longer the interval gaps become. The end result: the more you review, the longer it takes to forget. Not only is retention boosted, but study time is better optimized.

Generally these days spaced repetition is implemented with software, but that does not necessarily need to be the case. ['Leitner boxes'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) are an implementation of spaced repetition with physical flashcards and boxes to store them in based on proficiency. After reviewing cards, the cards move to boxes based on your ability to recall them, and the easier to remember cards end up being reviewed less often. 

# Getting the deck

Although approaches like this do work, I highly recommend using software to manage the spaced repetition for you, since they can provide greater configurability, allow you to track your progress over time, and manage everything for you, so that you can spend your time actually reviewing cards rather than handling technicalities. There are a large variety of both free and paid applications for the task, but my go-to is [Anki Flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). It's completely open source, easy to use, highly configurable, extendable, and has lots of community support, decks, and add-ons. It's completely free to use their website, desktop app, and android app, but their iPhone app is $25 (and worth every penny).

A copy of the deck can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wysbw8pV2i1xhy1Xwt3zRoyVMkC2zH5s/view?usp=share_link). I will try to frequently update the link with new cards as I add them, and Anki Flashcards should automatically merge in the new ones when you install updated decks.
