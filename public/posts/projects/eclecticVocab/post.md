# What?

Conglomeration, obstreperous, mercurial, preantepenultimate, rapacious, verisimilitude.
For some, it’s coins—for me, words. 

Over the past year, I’ve fastidiously curated those with intriguing meanings, idyllic spellings, eccentric pronunciations, and compelling origins.

Bolstering my lexicon and piquing my logophilia. An engrossing use of free-time tranches. A process as delightful as the product.

# The deck

As I encounter new, unknown words, I've stored them away in a [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) backlog, and every now and then convert the list into flashcards for my spaced-repetition Anki-flashcard deck. Spaced repetition is a special flashcard studying method wherein cards are automatically shown to you at specific intervals based on your response to remembering the card, as to show you the card at the moment before you are predicted to forget it. This maximizes study time efficiency, but more importantly, the process of recall when on the verge of forgetting is proven to boost long term retention.

A copy of the deck can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wysbw8pV2i1xhy1Xwt3zRoyVMkC2zH5s/view?usp=share_link). I will try to frequently update the link with new cards as I add them, and Anki Flashcards should automatically merge in the new ones when you install updated decks.
