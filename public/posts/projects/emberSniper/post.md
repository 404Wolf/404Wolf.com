# Inspiration

At first, Minecraft was nothing more than a sandbox for creativity and haven for ingenuity. I had done some tinkering with datapacks, improved my ability to arithmetically conceptualize problems with redstone, and contrived some unique art with WorldEdit, but none of my prior experience was anything like what was to come. Through the endeavor, I was able to combine my vocation with my love for solving unsolved problems. So, as usual, I dove in agog with extensive researching and impulsive tinkering. But before I get too far ahead of myself, I must go back to the beginning.

## NameMC

The first stage of the journey was discovery of the Minecraft-specific social media company [NameMc](https://namemc.com). Essentially, a website dedicated to indexing all Minecraft accounts, and then producing profiles wherein you could link socials and place art. But, one page caught my eye above the rest: [the minecraft names droptime table](https://namemc.com/minecraft-names). The compilation of usernames soon to be available immediately piqued my interest. Wouldn't it be just so cool to own the account with the username "adult," perhaps (one of the first real-word names I saw was 'dropping'). So, instinctively, I got myself situated at my desk, logged into my account's settings page, entered the name, and carefully hovered my cursor over the "Change Name" button. But, as it turned out, my single hopeful click was no match for the storm of thousands of automated 'sniper' requests that I would soon learn about on my adventure through the [Discord](https://discord.com)s of the industry. But when I learned that the account had sold for thousands of dollars, I was determined. In a community of mostly teens like me, I knew that with fervent learning, eager adapatation, and a reasonable investement, I could carve out my own nook

# Context


What would normally be an extremely complex task quickly turned out to be extraordinarily complex.

Names release a few milliseconds early, so I’d need to extensively experiment. Each account was allotted 3 name-change-requests a minute, so I’d need many accounts. And, same-IP-requests led to processing gaps, so I’d need many servers. In other words, an unexpectedly complex endeavor with a healthy blend of ingenuity and strategy.
