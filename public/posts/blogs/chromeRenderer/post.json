    "description": "In a quest to automate SVG file generation, I discovered Chrome's ability to convert complex SVGs with imports into self-contained PDFs through its printing protocol. My aim was to write a script to easily convert Chrome-preview-able files into PDFs. With Selenium and Chrome's Devtools Protocol, I was able to figure out how to perform the conversion, but wasn't satisfied. In this post, I discuss my script to convert complex files like SVGs to PDFs without any file handling, from memory to memory, headless-ly to allow for a smooth and efficient conversion process."
