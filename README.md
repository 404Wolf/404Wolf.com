# Personal Website Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal website. The website contains information about me, projects I've undertaken, and
some blogs discussing discoveries.

I've constructed the website to include an automated system for editing posts, rendering markdown, displaying content,
and more. It's a fullstack project, implementing `Next.JS`, `React`, `Prisma`, `Tailwind`, and `Typescript`, along
with `next-auth`. This repo is specific to my website, but I'm planning on generalizing the content to be usable by
anyone in the future; in a way, the site can be thought of as a from-scratch wordpress-in-nextjs. I intend to write a
full project page on the site shortly, and I'll make sure to include a link here when I do.

## Post Editing System

The website offers a complete post editing system, which dynamically stores content on S3.
