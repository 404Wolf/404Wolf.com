# Personal Website Portfolio
This is the repository for my personal website. The website contains information about me, projects I've undertaken, and some blogs discussing discoveries.

## Functionality
I've constructed the website to include an automated system for loading in a folder of project folders. Projects consist of a markdown file, json metadata file, and resources folder for media. The site implements a custom markdown parsing solution to automatically format images and groups of images, processed client-side. The site is designed to run on Vercel easily, and the site also includes a basic API. 

## Tools Used
* Typescript
* ReactJs
* NextJs
* TailwindCSS

## Future Plans
* Further refine the interface of the website
* Add a way for me to sign in as an admin so I can add and edit projects directly
* Implement an external backend server for hosting the projects and their data
* Improve loading time for project pages
* Add more animations and potentially sounds
