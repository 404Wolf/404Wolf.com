# Personal Website Portfolio
This is the repository for my personal website. The website contains information about me, projects I've undertaken, and some blogs discussing discoveries.

I've constructed the website to include an automated system for editing posts, rendering markdown, displaying content, and more. It's a fullstack project, implementing `Next.JS`, `React`, `Prisma`, `Tailwind`, and `Typescript`, along with `next-auth`. This repo is specific to my website, but I'm planning on generalizing the content to be usable by anyone in the future; in a way, the site can be thought of as a from-scratch wordpress-in-nextjs. I intend to write a full project page on the site shortly, and I'll make sure to include a link here when I do.
